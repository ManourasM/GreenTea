# Green Tea Engine

  Green Tea engine is a 2D Game Engine that is heavily inspired by [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) and [Cherno's](https://thecherno.com/) [Game Engine Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT). The Engine currently being developed only by me, in my own free time, with the only purpose of helping me understand better how game engines as well as game development works. I will **not** recommend using this Engine for final products. Instead I will advice you to use [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) that is being be used checked by a lot more people, or one of the well established game engines.

## Sandbox

  Green Tea engine comes with a folder called Sandbox where you can find an example project that you can use as a reference. Please read the wiki page to learn how to setup the project correctly.
